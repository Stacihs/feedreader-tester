# Memory Game
This is a project required for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. We had to write a test suite for a web-based application project that was supplied by Udacity.

## How to Run Application
You can download or clone this repository. Open the index.html file in a browser window. The test specs are located at the bottom of the page.

You can run all tests at once by clicking on 'Jasmine_TopLevel_Suite' and then scroll back down and click on 'Ran 0 of specs - run all'. The results will be located right above the test names. You also have the choice to run a particular test suite or an individual test, within a suite, just by clicking on its' title.

## Resources
Udacity provided the all the required project assets. There was only one test already wriiten, in the feedreader.js file. It is the first one, under 'RSS Feeds'. The project utilizes the Jasmine testing framework, Google fonts API, and Handlebars template system.
